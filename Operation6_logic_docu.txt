Basic Game Logic:
*check if space is open
*place x or o depending on turn
*check for winner
*check for tie (no winner, full board)

-----------------------------------
Removed the for loop at initialization because the array is already filled with zeros to begin with

added a winOrTie function to help the checkForWinner function

------------------------------------
Found a bug with using 'else if' in the check for winner scenario. Must use if statements because 'else if' will prevent some winning scenarios
